            <h2>Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Economics</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Hitchhiker’s Guide to Economics! 
                This guide, is mainly a collection of the mad ramblings of an 
                undergraduate student exploring economics. 
                While there’s some structure to the content, 
                this guide was mainly intended as a way to share my 
                thoughts and flesh out my ideas with my friends. As such, it has largely 
                manifested as a hodgepodge collection of insights, along with useful 
                resources I’ve stumbled upon. Since I am but a simple undergraduate student, 
                mistakes are bound to happen, and corrections are appreciated.</p>
